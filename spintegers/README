Hello Mr. Yates.

I guess you figured out how to clone the git repository - congratulations!

Now for some git basics.

To add a file to the repository, type "git add (filename)"

To do a LOCAL commit (just updates your private working copy, nothing
that I can see), type 'git commit -a -m "some message"'. The "-a" part 
is telling it to include all modified files in the commit.

(Of course "some message" should briefly state what you changed since
the last commit!)

After you have done a LOCAL commit to save your changes, you can
interact safely with the shared repository. To update your local copy
with the shared one, do a "git pull". Once you are up to date with that
and have some new commits to check in, type "git push".

Of course there is near-infinite greater complexity and power with git,
and I encourage you to explore it. Google is your friend...

Have fun!

-DR
